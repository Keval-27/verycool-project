DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. 
The goal is to shorten the systems development life cycle (SDLC), increase deployment frequency, and provide more dependable releases, all while ensuring the quality of the software.
